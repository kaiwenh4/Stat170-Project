## ER diagram for Yelp dataset
1. open https://app.diagrams.net/
2. open the ER_for_yelp.drawio in the website

## yelp dataset import steps
1. Go to https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download to download both photo and review dataset.
2. unzip two .tar files --> you will get two file without suffix --> add ".tar" to two new files --> unzip them again
3. run the "yelp_data_setup.sql" in your local SQL server
4. run the "yelp_import.ipynb" in python 
    (ps: please put all the source files in the same document with the python code!!)

## Shop's categories.txt
It is a text file saving all the categories used by Yelp dataset. 

## .gitignore
It helps me to ignore the change notice for the sources files in the local document.
