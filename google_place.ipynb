Google only cares about its ad what a selfish tech. There is not even a live chat, my password linked with google is compromised but there is no one to talk to. the 1800 no is a useless no or even the no provided at this store is useless. Google support only asks to send a feedback of the problem and nothing else. I had sent it but its been more than a month no one has contacted still. Such a selfish, greedy billionaire tech giant. Cant believe, even a small struggling bussiness has someone to chat to. Such a low pathetic moral of google . Humanity will not be too long if our biggest tech are surround by just greed of $$$$$$....Shame on you # greedygoogle#greedysundarpichai#Australiagoogletaxloot.\",\n",

I guess when you are as big as they are they can do what they want as there is not really another alternative. I use their services such as maps and mail but also contribute a lot of data such as photo’s and reviews. I was under the impression that what I was doing was helping others in the community. I had not realised that google could pick and choose who used these services and can block out any one out they don’t like. I was very upset when they black baned some Chinese manufactures who are making really good products. I had also not realised that Google is a slave to any crazy president that gets into power. Anyway I will keep using  their products as they are good and hope that one day they will be available for all to use.\",\n",
