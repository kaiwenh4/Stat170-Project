      "/n new:  Very cool bar attached to the Alexander Hotel. Several vintage cocktails from pre-prohibition are on the menu. None cooler than \"The Elephant in the Room\" a bourbon cocktail which comes in its own decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. You decide how long to let it infuse. Lots of comfortable seating and when it warms up a touch a large beautiful deck with seating and heating overlooks the street life. As an added bonus you can relax and watch people work out through the glass of the new CityWay YMCA. \n",

The green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for.  ($10 I think) The Santa Barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent! Cold brew coffee was good. Lots of good choices in the grab and go section, and our salami and pesto sammy was also great. I'd go back!\n",
      "/n new:  Good menu, solid ingredients, but these folks are not sandwich artists.  I had a Turkey and Brie Wrap one day and the Spinach Florentine Wrap the next.  Both \"wraps\" could have more fittingly been called \"crumples\" because that's how they were assembled.  While watching the sandwich line I kept thinking, \"Thank god they're not trying to fold burritos!\"  Everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago.  Also, can we please hang a few signs like \"order here\", \"pick-up here,\" \"pay-here\" to direct traffic instead of the east coast \"If you don already know, then leave!\" attitude?\n",

      "/n new:  I made my Yelp account for the soul purpose of reviewing this place; I think that very much speaks to how I enjoyed the experience. It's exactly what you would expect from a local cafe/coffee shop and then some. The food and coffee were great and the atmosphere was very friendly and casual. The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love. The service was a bit slow, but the barista was the only person working behind the counter and she was also very personable, so for that we can forgive her. When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter. I also appreciated the dog-friendly policy but that's definitely a personal preference and isn't right for everyone. The location is also great, being situated in the French quarter. My only complaint is that I could only visit once on my trip to New Orleans.\n",

I'm a breakfast fanatic so I get little over critical.  However, this small cafe has managed to create incredible flavor while keeping their dishes fresh and simplistic.  While the actual space is \"cozy,\" this menu could easily keep a place as big as Parc overflowing with patrons.\n",
      "/n new:  Really not sure what the hype was when it opened. It's fine, the ambiance was nice, but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about. They are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait, then you have things to see...\n",
      "/n new:  This place was amazing! I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \n",

      "/n new:  During the parents' visit,  dad wanted some southern food. We tried Willie Maes, but the line was long and they weren't crazy about the area.  So we waited a bit and went down to The Praline Connection. Dad was in heaven. He's been talking about the food since we left. Dad got the taste of soul platter pictured below. He said the fried chicken was the best he's had and he had not tasted red beans and rice like that since he was a kid and my granny used to make em. Mom got the meatloaf with cabbage and lima beans. I got the ribs with potato salad and mac and cheese. My ribs were good but hard to cut the meat off the bone. I could've ate em with my hands but I didn't want a BBQ face. The potato salad was good but my mac & cheese was a little bland. The cornbread was great.  I'm going back next time for the fried chicken!\n",
      "/n new:  Buddy Brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in Tampa. Their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice.

I also had a vanilla latte which was yummy....no extra sweeteners needed. \n",

      "/n new:  Try the spinach and feta hummus, it is amazing. I had the chicken caesar pita and if was wonderful. The caesar dressing was very flavorful and the greens (romaine, mixed greens, etc) were good quality and flavorful (not your typical bagged junk). Pulling up the the place I was skeptical (they're in an old garage) but give it a try, well worth it.\n",

The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. \n",

In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I'll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit.\n",
      "/n new:  Great ice cream, absolutely terrible service. My son and I went in for ice cream on a Sunday afternoon, so maybe they have their worst staff working on a Sunday. We walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter. The girl (who seemed drunk) was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me. No big deal, but no apology, just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing. The guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything. I get it, no one wants sandy little hands in the candy. But he wasn't touching anything, so this was just rude. We stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us, no smile, no greeting, she didn't even look at us. Perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting. She ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited, more loud shouty laughter. I'm all about a great fun atmosphere and I know I sound like a bore. But when it comes hand-in-hand with a rude attitude towards paying customers, it crosses a line.\n",

      "/n new:  I really wanted to like this place and heard about it during lent when I had given up meat. I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \n",

      "The chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n",
      "\n",
      "The new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n",

Best donuts in Philly and the Delaware Valley.\n",
      "/n new:  Finally got to check out Cafe Soleil. One word: Delicieux!! Being from France, I had high expectations, I don't play with my pastries! Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker \"Nico\" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery.\n",

Decent selection of coffees, they have french press as well. Menu isn't huge which is nice so you can figure out what you want quickly. Food comes how in a decent time.

      "/n new:  Delicious food, sub-par service. I stopped into this dessert bar today to grab some dessert and a coffee to-go. While everyone seemed to be very helpful, or at least wanting to be, I'm not sure I received the best possible service. I ordered two slices of cake, one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake. Both were DELICIOUS, but it seemed like I waited forever to receive these, and when i did, it was in a cute but inefficient manner. The to-go boxes were stacked one on top of the other, with a loosely tied string around them. While I admire the aesthetics here, I would have much preferred a bag. Though, the worst part of my experience was the barista. I ordered an iced coffee with milk and sugar. First, he put ice in the cup and filled it halfway with coffee. He then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated \"I wouldn't know what and how much you want, I only drink my coffee black.\" As I considered this incompetent statement, i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve. But no, he proceeded to fill the rest of the HALF OF THE CUP with milk. And then handing me the drink he told me I'd better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in. Not sure why I'd paid such a high price to practically make my own half-coffee half-mild beverage, I simply smiled and walked away. I ended up throwing out the drink as I could hardly even taste the coffee and I'm not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee. Nonetheless, the cakes were delicious, and I will be coming back with the hopes that this new business is still in the process of improving itself.\n",

      "/n new:  Use the yelp app to get on the waiting list, we went on a Saturday morning and it was very busy, but the waiting list was cut down significantly by using the app. The menu is expansive, a lot of options. The cinnamon French toast was very good. The traditional breakfast foods were on par with most breakfast joints, but the extras on the menu can keep you busy for many visits trying new things. The strawberry orange juice was excellent so I recommend trying it. It was a little hot in the restaurant, could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience. The service was very good. There were two places to pay at the counter which I thought was a nice way to speed up the leaving process.\n",
      "/n new:  Not only was the food excellent, but the people here are beyond nice-and genuine. I had eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on was excellent. We were given a cream pancakes to taste test by our awesome server, Tina. I can honestly say it was the best pancake I've ever tasted. So full of flavour-vanilla, and soft aa pillow.  They melted in my mouth. I didn't even use syrup. Stellar!\n",

      "/n new:  Where do I start? Brew D Licious has the very best coffee in town. Hands down. I have tried them all and can say that there isn't another coffee house that even comes close. The minute I met the owner, I knew she was not only very well informed about how to brew a great cup of coffee, but also knows how to make the toughest of customer a repeat patron. This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel. I know it will be a long line at the new location but it will be worth the wait.... Thanks Brigitte for showing St. Petersburg what real coffee tastes and smells like!\n",
      "/n new:  Most of the time I go through the drive thru here.  While sometimes the line is a bit long I have to say these guys move in record time.  The line moves fast and my coffee is waiting for me when I get to the window.  How much more can you ask for? \n",

It's about two minutes away from the Wayne Starbucks, but believe me when I say that all the cool informed coffee connoisseurs flock to Gryphon Cafe.  Its setting is quiet and intimate.It exudes a chill and serene vibe, from its very dim lighting and small (in a good way!) space.  The lattes are very good- made with strong espresso.  In addition, it provides various baked goods, although I've had a really dry, stale brownie from there (A big no-no! As a result, I don't care too much for the baked goods).  In addition, Gryphon supports a lively local music scene; music begins at 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.\n",

Firstly, I came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when I told the lady taking my order, she said they don't do that -__-. Then I wanted that buttermilk bites and they weren't available, however, my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that!! Oh yes, and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry. I liked the sliders I had though: fried chicken, beef belly and catfish(okay). And the sundae is pretty tasty.

Iced coffee came out quickly and are banana bread and we went outside to sit with and realize there is no area connected to this restaurant for outdoor seating. The restaurant next-door however was not yet open so we sat at one of their tables thinking no one would mind. It would be nice if the coffee house itself had its own outdoor seating. Are iced coffee was very good and hit the spot. The vegan banana bread was good but seemed very dense to me. I'll be back another time to try some more of the fancy coffee they have available here. I'm hoping that they will add to the food menu as well as a try to not eat donuts most days. Maybe a breakfast sandwich or some other option than a pastry would be good.\n",

They also offer tap and sparking water to customers which is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly. My friend and I chatted with one of the baristas for a few minutes and he gave us some pro-tips on how to make a killer espresso. I will definitely be coming back here again soon!\n",
      "/n new:  Nothing makes my busy day easy like my iced coffee at Starbucks and this location botched it up for me:( see my photo yup those are coffee grinds at the bottom a whole bunch of coffee grinds:( yuck yuck!\n",

      "\n",
      " This was my first time in a Dunkin and probably my last if its common for employees to be on the phone obviously talking to a friend while making a vague attempt to take someones order. It was also the worst donut I ever had mostly because it was as hard as a rock. No quality control!\n",
      "/n new:  The atmosphere was nice and small. Very busy for brunch, expect at least a 30-45 minute wait. I recommend the spinach, caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet, but request a little less goat cheese. (this one was way too much, would have been better with 1/2 the amount).  Oh and the fruit was served perfectly ripe. Cash only.\n",
      "/n new:  This shop is a slice of Disney beauty and magic hiding on the edge of Broad Ripple, and a MUST stop of sweets, treats, and dreaminess. Your Instagram needs this place. Hands down the ~best~ red velvet cake of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appearance: The Cake Bake Shop is a beautifully decorated, small white house with a captivating design. The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.\n",

      "Food: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake, unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while, so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE\n",
      "\n",
      "I was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Customer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! \n",

      "I had the Pan con Bistec, and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back! \n",
      "\n",
      "And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love. \n",

      "(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major points for:  \n",
      "*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n",
      "*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\n",
      "*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.\n",
      "*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\n",
      "*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\n",

      "Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  \n",
      "Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)\n",
      "Overall:  This place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 24/7.  This store does a lot right!\n",
      "/n new:  Worst Wawa in the Tri-State area. Always full of druggies, weirdos, creeps, panhandlers and the worst deli staff ever.\n",
      "/n new:  I have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.\n",
      "/n new:  The experience is fun and girly, but the food doesn't back it up.  Go for dessert or a cocktail, don't get a full meal. I don't think it's worth it.\n",
      "/n new:  This is a gigantic restaurant with ample seating and a nice ambience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beverages: This is the perfect place for cocktails, coffee and  cider. There is a wide variety of drink selections, and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu \n",
      "\n",
      "Starters: The New Orleans BBQ shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo. These little guys are like crack, and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce \n",
      "\n",
      "Entrees: The curried chicken salad is fantastic, though I wish they would consider serving it on different bread (it comes on two mini sandwich rolls). The BLT is also a good choice (the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious), and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert: I don't even know where to start. The Brown Shugga pie is stupid good. It never would have occurred me to order it because I don't sit around thinking about brown sugar, but a friend of mine did and I ate almost the whole thing. It's ooey, gooey, rich and delicious. The key lime pie is also a spectacular pick, as is the apple crisp. I've had almost every dessert on the menu, and not one of them has been a disappointment. The carrot cake might be one of the biggest slabs you can get in the entire United States... and it is so worth every last calorie.\n"
